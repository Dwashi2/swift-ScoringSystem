<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
 
      Andy, Ben and Charlotte are playing a board game.
      The three of them decided to come up with a new scoring system. 
      A player's first initial ("A", "B" or "C") denotes that player scoring a single point. 
      Given a string of capital letters, return an array of the players' scores.
      For instance, if ABBACCCCAC is written when the game is over, then Andy scored 3 points, 
      Ben scored 2 points, and Charlotte scored 5 points, since there are 3 instances of letter A,
      2 instances of letter B, and 5 instances of letter C. So the array [3, 2, 5] should be returned.
      
      Examples:
      calculateScores("A") ➞ [1, 0, 0]
      calculateScores("ABC") ➞ [1, 1, 1]
      calculateScores("ABCBACC") ➞ [2, 2, 3]
      
      Notes:
      If given an empty string as an input, return [0, 0, 0].
